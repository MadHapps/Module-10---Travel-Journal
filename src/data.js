      "In 2015 I went on a road trip from Sacramento to San Francisco by taking the scenic route. I traveled through Clear Lake to Fort Bragg and slept in my car in a motel parking lot. After visiting Glass Beach at Sunrise, I began the almost 5 hour drive from Fort Bragg to San Francisco via CA-1, California's coastal highway. I stopped at two lighthouses along the way in Point Arena and Point Reyes. Point Arena was nice, but Point Reyes was the one I was really excited(read: nostalgic) for, as I only had vague memories of it from going there when I was very young. Even though I was tired from driving, sunlight dwindling, and still more than an hour from SF, I made the hour detour(30min. there and back to CA-1) to visit Point Reyes. It was a hike from the parking lot, but, completely unplanned, I reached the lookout point exactly in the middle of golden hour and took the photo you see here. One of the most awe inspiring experiences I've ever had.",

      "Evolution Lake is 11,000ft above sea level, and where we're standing in the photo marks the half-way point of a 4-day, 55-mile backpacking adventure I went on in 2015 with two of my close friends. Amazingly, it was suppose to take five days, but we finished a day faster than planned, perks of being in our mid-twenties I suppose. The trail we embarked on was the North Lake To South Lake Loop, a breathtaking journey that traverses some of the most awe-inspiring landscapes in the Sierra Nevada. Along the way, hikers are treated to panoramic vistas of towering granite peaks, crystal-clear alpine lakes, and lush meadows teeming with wildflowers. From the serene shores of Evolution Lake to the dramatic vistas of Muir Pass, every step on this trail is a testament to the beauty and adventure awaiting those who dare to explore it.",

      "New Brighton Beach holds a special place in my heart, despite all of the seaweed. While it may not have the warmest waters or the smoothest sand, its rugged charm and nostalgic allure are unmatched. Just behind me in this photo, perched atop the cliffs, is New Brighton Campground, a place filled with memories that evoke the scent of salt, pine, and iron. My family's annual summer camping trip to New Brighton was always the most anticipated event, each journey filled with the excitement of exploration and the soothing sounds of waves crashing against the shore. As a child, I was the perennial 'Are we there yet?' kid, and for me, 'there' was always New Brighton. The narrow cliffside trail leading from the campground to the beach was a thrilling adventure in itself, promising endless hours of sandy fun. Yet, beyond the campground, awaited further adventureâ€”whether strolling along the nearby railroad tracks to reach the vibrant seaside town of Capitola, with its colorful shops, or venturing a short ride to The Beach Boardwalk, where laughter and excitement echoed against the backdrop of the sea. Despite its cold water, New Brighton Beach remains a cherished destination, where every visit is a journey back to the carefree days of youth.",
